# Lab 7 Info

For this lab I chose to cover SymPy, a Python libray that does symbolic math calculations

Create a virtual environment if you want, or don't

To install just do:

```
pip install sympy
```

In this example I show how Sympy can be used to compute equalities, limits, derivatives, integrals, and series
