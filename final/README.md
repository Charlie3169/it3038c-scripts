# Final project

For this project I made a complex number plotter that uses Sympy as a backend for any functions I'd want to graph. I've always wanted an easy way to graph stuff on the complex plane (especially in a reusable way) and this project is a good start

**Instructions on running the project:** 

pip install notebook

pip install sympy

**Then in the project directory:**

jupyter notebook
